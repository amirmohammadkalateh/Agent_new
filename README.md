This repository contains implementations and explanations related to reinforcement learning (RL) agents.

## Introduction

Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, which relies on labeled data, RL agents learn through trial and error, interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

An **agent** in RL is an entity that perceives its environment, takes actions, and learns to optimize its behavior based on the rewards it receives. The agent's goal is to learn a policy, which maps states to actions, that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

## Key Concepts

* **Environment:** The external system that the agent interacts with. It provides states and rewards to the agent based on its actions.
* **State (s):** A representation of the environment's current situation.
* **Action (a):** A decision made by the agent that affects the environment.
* **Reward (r):** A scalar value that indicates the immediate consequence of an action. Positive rewards reinforce desirable actions, while negative rewards discourage undesirable ones.
* **Policy (π):** A function that maps states to actions. It defines the agent's behavior. Represented as $\pi(a|s)$, the probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$.
* **Value Function (V(s)):** The expected cumulative reward from a given state. It estimates how good it is to be in a particular state.
    * State-value function: $V(s) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [G_t | S_t = s]$
* **Q-function (Q(s, a)):** The expected cumulative reward from taking a specific action in a given state. It estimates how good it is to take a particular action in a particular state.
    * Action-value function: $Q(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a]$
* **Discount Factor (γ):** A value between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards relative to immediate rewards.
* **Episode:** A complete sequence of states, actions, and rewards from an initial state to a terminal state.
* **Trajectory:** The full sequence of states, actions, and rewards, represented as: $τ = (s_0, a_0, r_1, s_1, a_1, r_2, ..., s_T)$.
* **Return (G_t):** The total discounted reward from time step $t$ onwards. Represented as: $G_t = \sum_{k=0}^{T-t-1} \gamma^k r_{t+k+1}$.

## Agent Learning Process

The agent learns through the following iterative process:

1.  **Observation:** The agent observes the current state of the environment.
2.  **Action Selection:** The agent selects an action based on its current policy.
3.  **Action Execution:** The agent executes the selected action in the environment.
4.  **Reward and Next State:** The environment provides a reward and the next state to the agent.
5.  **Policy Update:** The agent updates its policy based on the received reward and the next state, aiming to maximize the cumulative reward.
6.  **Iteration:** The process repeats until the agent converges to an optimal policy or reaches a termination condition.

## Common RL Algorithms

* **Q-Learning:** An off-policy algorithm that learns the optimal Q-function.
* **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):** An on-policy algorithm that learns the Q-function for the current policy.
* **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** A variant of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function.
* **Policy Gradient Methods (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, A3C):** Algorithms that directly optimize the policy function.
* **Actor-Critic Methods:** Algorithms that combine policy gradient and value function methods.
